# Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis




### Problem Statement


As a Data Scientist who works for the California school board I was given the task to investigate if the city where the students school is located based of the household income has an affect on the students SATs and ACT scores. Does attending a school located in a city with a higher household income correlate with a increased amount of students who take the test and also a higher score and vice versa?

### Background

To begin my research I wanted to find the cities in California with the highest household incomes. I used the link below to find from the data provided Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Mateo and San Bernardino have the highest household income. In reality there are other cities in California that have higher household incomes but this data provided does not include those cities so I used the highest household incomes in the given data.


### Outside Research


When I was doing outside research i cam across a article in Education Week named The SAT is Making a comeback. Here's a Look at the Numbers and What they tell us. by Illeana Najarro. In this article they talk about Percentage of Students Who Scored 1300 or Higher on the SAT where they show the higher the parents income the hgiher the student scores. This is what spiked my interest to look into if you live in a higher income city will the students have a higher score. I wanted to see if the graph in this article will look similar to the research I will be completing.


### Conclusion

In conclusion the cities with higher household income does increase the amount of students who take the SATs and ACT. We can see from the graphs Los Angeles and San Bernandio have a higher amount of test takers compared to the other Cities for both SATs and ACTs. This did not apply to all cities but the highest amount of test takers did come from 2 of the cities with a high household income.

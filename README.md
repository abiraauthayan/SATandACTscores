# The Effect of Household Income on Students SAT and ACT scores




### Problem Statement


As a Data Scientist who works for the California school board I was given the task to investigate if the city where the students school is located based of the household income has an affect on the students SATs and ACT scores. Does attending a school located in a city with a higher household income correlate with a increased amount of students who take the test and have a higher score and vice versa?

### Background

To begin my research I wanted to find the cities in California with the highes household income. I used the link below to find from the data provided San Francisco, Orange County, San Barbara and San Diego have the highest household income in this data. In reality there are other cities in California that have higher household incomes but this data provided does not include those cities so I used the highest household incomes in the given data.

To give context of what the highest household income in california is, San Ramon being the highest household income of $161,870 in California. In this data set San Francisco as the highest household income of 94,000 dollars

### Outside Research


When I was doing outside research i cam across a article in Education Week named The SAT is Making a comeback. Here's a Look at the Numbers and What they tell us. by Illeana Najarro. In this article they talk about Percentage of Students Who Scored 1300 or Higher on the SAT where they show the higher the parents income the hgiher the student scores. This is what spiked my interest to look into if you live in a higher income city will the students have a higher score. I wanted to see if the graph in this article will look similar to the research I will be completing.

### Conclusion

After completing my analysis, for the year 2018 to 2019 there are no correlations between having a high household income and recieving high scores on the SAT and ACT or on the amount of test takers. Actually from my analysis it was proven the opposite. The lowest income household city in California is 35,000 dollars and as you saw above all the cities with the highest amount of benchmark students and highest amount of test takers all had a household income from 36,000 to 56,000. Modoc having one of the lowest household incomes in California but had the highest amount of grade 12 ACT test takers, which was very interesting to see.

In conclusion the cities with higher household income does not increase the amount of students who take the SATs and ACT or lead to higher test scores. The data from Edweek was from 2011-2015 data so in my observations things have drasticlly changed since then and the students parents salary does not reflect on the students SAT or ACT grades anymore (in 2018-2019).
